        <p class="b">Make in India is an initiative by the Government of India to create and encourage companies to develop, manufacture and assemble products made in India and incentivize dedicated investments into manufacturing. The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop a modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital. The initiative targeted 25 economic sectors for job creation and skill enhancement, and aimed "to transform India into a global design and manufacturing export hub.

"Make in India" had three stated objectives:

to increase the manufacturing sector's growth rate to 12-14% per annum;
to create 100 million additional manufacturing jobs in the economy by 2022;
to ensure that the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP is increased to 25% by 2022 (later revised to 2025). </p>
